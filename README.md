This project demonstrates a Python-based web scraping solution that automates the extraction of tabular data from a webpage, processes it into a structured format, and exports it as a CSV file. Using libraries like BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML and Pandas for data manipulation, the code fetches column headers and row data from a table on a web page and saves the resulting dataset into a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.

Key Features:

Extracts column titles and row data from HTML table structures.
Processes and cleans the data for structured representation in a Pandas DataFrame.
Outputs the processed data into a CSV file for easy sharing or analysis.
Use Case:
This project can be utilized to automate data collection tasks from websites, such as collecting statistics, records, or company data, which is particularly useful for data analysts and researchers dealing with web data.
